### The Language
**Solidity** is a contract-oriented, high-level language for implementing smart contracts on Ethereum. It was influenced by C++, Python and JavaScript and is designed to target the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

Solidity is statically typed, supports inheritance, libraries and complex user-defined types among other features.

With Solidity is possible to create contracts for voting, crowdfunding, blind auctions, multi-signature wallets and more.

### ERC20 Token Protocol
**ERC** stands for **Ethereum Request for Comments**. This is an official protocol for proposing improvements to the Ethereum network. '20â€™ is the unique proposal ID number.

**ERC20** defines a set of rules which need to be met in order for a token to be accepted and called as 'ERC20 Token'. The standard rules apply to all ERC20 Tokens since these rules are required to interact with each other on the Ethereum network. These tokens are blockchain assets that have value and can be sent and received, like Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, or any other cryptocurrency. 

The difference between these tokens and a standalone currency like Litecoin is that ERC20 tokens piggyback on the Ethereum network, hosted by Ethereum addresses and sent by Ethereum transactions.

On this repository you will find some examples of ERC20 tokens that I develop while I was develop my knowledge as **Blockchain Developer**.
