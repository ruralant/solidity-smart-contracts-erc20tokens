###The Language
**Solidity** is a contract-oriented, high-level language for implementing smart contracts. It was influenced by C++, Python and JavaScript and is designed to target the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

Solidity is statically typed, supports inheritance, libraries and complex user-defined types among other features.

With Solidity is possible to create contracts for voting, crowdfunding, blind auctions, multi-signature wallets and more.

###ERC20 Token Protocol
(work in progress)
